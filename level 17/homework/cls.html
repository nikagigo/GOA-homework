    <p>Marketed from Mercedes as a four-door coupé, the CLS was designed by Michael Fink in 
    2001 who also styled the first generation CLK, the C-SportCoupé, and Maybach 57 and 62.
    In Europe, the CLS is recognized as a four-seat coupé and justly named the C219, while 
    in the US, it is commonly referred to as the W219. The C219 CLS is based on the W211 E-Class
    platform, and shares major components including the engines, transmissions, and has an identical
    wheelbase of 2,854 mm (112 in). IVM Automotive, a subsidiary of German roof system specialist 
    Edscha, developed the entire vehicle from the Vision CLS concept on which the CLS is based, to 
    the production version which debuted at the 2004 New York International Auto Show.</p>
